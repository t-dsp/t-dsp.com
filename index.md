# What is T-DSP?

T-DSP is an open modular audio platform designed for musicians, engineers, and developers who want powerful digital signal processing in a flexible, hackable format. Built around a high-performance Teensy microcontroller and a high quality codec, T-DSP combines studio-quality audio with a growing library of open-source modules for mixing, synthesis, effects, and more.

Whether you're building a custom digital mixer, crafting a unique instrument, or prototyping audio products, T-DSP gives you the tools to bring your ideas to lifeâ€”no proprietary systems, no licensing walls, just clean, creative freedom.

Join the community, contribute to the library, or grab a module and start patching.
